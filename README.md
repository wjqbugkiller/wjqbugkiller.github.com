### 基础介绍

> #### What is Arduino
> - Arduino is an open source electronic platform that includes hardware and software.
> - The hardware part is an Arduino board that can be used for circuit connection, and the software part is Arduino IDE which is a program in the computer that used for development.
> - Software（Arduino IDE）can be downloaded from [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/)

> #### The function of Arduino
>> Output device
>> - Arduino can use existing electronic components, such as switches, drives or many other sensors to make an interactive device. It can be used to make hardware equipment such as electronic production or creative design prototypes.

>> Art interactive works
>> - Arduino can also build art interactive works though integrating ideas and sensors in a simple or unified way. Using sensors to sense and affect the environment by controlling lights, motors and other devices. This kind of work can be an original object, a wall, or combined with other objects in life.

>> Interactive software
>> - Arduino can be used with many software, such as processing, brain-link, etc. Their cooperation can create many interesting visually interactive software or pages. Interaction with the computer is no longer limited to the mouse and keyboard. Sound, infrared, touch, pressure human motion catcher and many other facts can become the input source of the computer.

> #### The choice for Arduino
>> - The official Arduino team adopted the Creative Commons license. Anyone is allowed to produce and sell copies of the Arduino development board. Therefore, there are two kinds of development boards.Therefore, there are two kinds of development boards, one is the official board, and the other is the clone board of other manufacturers. 
>> 
>> - Both official boards and clone boards are legal products.
>> 
>> - The production process of the official board will be more excellent and more expensive.

>> - There are many types of Arduino development board, which can be roughly divided into five categories: Entry Level, Enhanced Features, Internet of Things, Education, and Retired.
>> 
>> - You can view all of them from the official website:[Arduino.Products](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Products)
>> 
>> - There are not much options for us, we got only Arduino UNO. We have two pieces in our hands. One is turquoise and the other is black. They are both made in China. We can easily buy them in a cheap price.

> #### Connection with computer
>> Wire
>> 
>> - Two types of wires in our group
>> 
>> Development board and port selection
>> - ‘Arduino on comX’ is in the lower right corner of the Arduino IDE. X stands for number.
>> 
>> - Click the ‘工具 – 开发板’ at the toolbar and choose the Arduino type. 
>> 
>> - Then select the comX in the ‘工具-端口’.

### 小组作业介绍

> ### Case 1: LED light with a button

>> - We tried this case in the class to learn about the basic digital I/O in Arduino. In this case, we can control the LED light with a button. When the button is pressed,  the LED light is off; otherwise the light is on.
Here is the circuit of this case.

>> - Here is the code and the video of this case:
```c
int ledPin=13;//led连接pin的13脚
int inPin=7;
int val=0;

void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  pinMode(ledPin,OUTPUT);
  pinMode(inPin,INPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  val=digitalRead(inPin);
  digitalWrite(ledPin,val);

}
```
> #### Case 2: LED light with a button: pro version

>> - When we finished Case 1, we felt a little bit inconvenient in this application for we usually turn on the light with one press and then turn it off with another. In Case 1, however, the light is on immediately when we release the button. So, we did some changes to Case 1 code and made it a pro version.

>> - Here is the code and the video of this case:
```c
const int buttonPin = 7;
const int ledPin = 13;

// 按键前一个状态
int oldButtonState = HIGH;
// 按键状态
int buttonState = HIGH;
// led灯状态，false->没亮，true->亮
boolean ledState = false;


void setup() {
  // 使用内置上拉电阻
  pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT_PULLUP);
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // 单次按动开关LED灯
  oldButtonState = buttonState;
  buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);
  if(buttonState == LOW && oldButtonState == HIGH) {
    if(ledState == true) {
      digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
    } 
    else {
      digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
    }
    ledState = !ledState;
  }
}
```

> #### Case 3: try something new: Speech recognition module & Gesture recognition module
>> - For some of our group members have tried Arduino before, we have some other modules which are not included in the basic Arduino kit. So we used the speech recognition module and the gesture recognition module in our Case 3.
>> 
>> - In this case, the user should speak the word “kai shi”（开始）to start and get into the gesture recognition mode, which will turn on the green LED light at the same time to show that you are allowed to do the gesture. When the user move his ore her hand left and right, the red light will be on; but if the hand is moving up and down, the yellow light will be on otherwise. After finishing the gesture recognition, the green light and the indicator light will be off and the device will get into the next loop.
>>
>> - Here is the circuit:

### 模型

> #### An Elastic (rubber band) Powered Car
>> - We used Creo to build a simple 3D model of an elastic (rubber band) powered car. The car is driven by rubber bands and can travel a distance in a straight line. Its main components are: body bracket (using lighter carbon fiber tubes to reduce resistance), connection structure , Bevel gears, bearings, screws, rotating modules, tires, wheels.

> #### Three-view Drawing
> 
> #### Exploded Views
> 
> #### Components
>> - In the process of creating the model, we used functions such as sketching, extruding, drafting, building threads, rounding, circular bending, drawing space curves, boundary blending, surface merging, solidification, dimensioning, etc. Since Creo has certain limitations when creating curved surfaces, the car shows more straight lines and planes, and it takes more time to create the surface of the racing wheel hub.
